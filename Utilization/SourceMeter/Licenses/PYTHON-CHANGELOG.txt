University of Szeged modified the source of the python 2.7.8 lib. The following changes were made:
1. Python lib now collects the end line and end column information of the parsed statements as well (originally it recorded only start lines and start columns)
2. Some unnecessary files and folders have been removed
3. Config files, make/vcxproj files have been restructured slightly
